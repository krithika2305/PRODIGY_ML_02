# Prodigy Info Tech - Machine Learning Internship Task 02    
## 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project applies **K-Means clustering** to segment customers based on their spending behavior and income, helping businesses to better understand and target their customers.

## 🔗 Dataset
Dataset used: Kaggle Customer Segmentation Dataset

## 📊 Dataset Features:

Gender --	Gender of the customer (Male / Female)  
Age --	Age of the customer (in years)  
Annual Income (k$) --	Customer’s yearly income (in thousands of dollars, e.g., 70 = $70,000)  
Spending Score (1-100) --	A score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending pattern (higher = spends more)  

## 🧩 Cluster Descriptions
-- Cluster 0: Moderate income, moderate spending  
-- Cluster 1: High income, high spending  
-- Cluster 2: Low income, low spending  
-- Cluster 3: High income, low spending  
-- Cluster 4: Low income, high spending
