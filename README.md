# Prodigy Info Tech - Machine Learning Internship Task 02    
## 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project applies **K-Means clustering** to segment customers based on their spending behavior and income, helping businesses to better understand and target their customers.

## 🔗 Dataset
Dataset used: [Kaggle Customer Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)

## 📊 Dataset Features: 
CustomerID -- Unique ID assigned to each customer (used as an identifier)  
Gender --	Gender of the customer (Male / Female)  
Age --	Age of the customer (in years)  
Annual Income (k$) --	Customer’s yearly income (in thousands of dollars, e.g., 70 = $70,000)  
Spending Score (1-100) --	A score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending pattern (higher = spends more)  

## 🧩 Cluster Descriptions
-- Cluster 0: Moderate income, moderate spending  
-- Cluster 1: High income, high spending  
-- Cluster 2: Low income, low spending  
-- Cluster 3: High income, low spending  
-- Cluster 4: Low income, high spending  

## Features Used for Clustering
Annual Income (k$)  
Spending Score (1-100)
